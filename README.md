# Sample Note App
A small application I decide to make using Codeigniter and MaterializeCSS.
The project is to made the same application with the same feature using different technologies all the time.

## Installation
* clone this repo inside a fresh installation of Codeigniter (3.0.6),
* import the dump of the database (I included the create schema ;)),
* update application/config/database.php with your credential to acces the db and also config.php the base url property,
* go to <base url> and login with username:dummy@user and password:password.

If you want to try it out go to my [website](http://note.mattiadellamina.it/login) and login with the above user, enjoy ;).

Here cames the screenshots.
